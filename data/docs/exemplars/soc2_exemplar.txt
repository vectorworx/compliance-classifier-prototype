Security Controls Overview (SOC 2)

All users must use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for interactive access to production systems.
Access is provisioned on a least privilege basis and reviewed quarterly.

Security events are logged centrally; logs are retained for at least 90 days online and are reviewed weekly
for anomalies. Administrative actions are auditable and subject to change management.
