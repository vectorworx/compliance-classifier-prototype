Policy: Personal Data Breach Response

We notify the supervisory authority within seventy-two hours of any personal data breach, without undue delay,
and document the nature of the breach and the number of records affected.

Personal data is collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner
that is incompatible with those purposes. Data subjects retain the right to erasure under applicable conditions.
